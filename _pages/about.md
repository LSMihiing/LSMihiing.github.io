李世明同学是[江苏第二师范学院](https://www.jssnu.edu.cn/)[物理与信息工程学院](https://pe.jssnu.edu.cn/main.htm)的大三学生。专业是物理学（师范）专业，个人理想是拿到理学博士学位并进入大学任教。

Student Li Shiming is a junior at [Jiangsu Second Normal University](https://www.jssnu.edu.cn/), majoring in Physics and Information Engineering at the [School of Physics and Information Engineering](https://pe.jssnu.edu.cn/main.htm). His major is in Physics (Normal Education), and his personal aspiration is to obtain a Doctor of Philosophy in the field of science and become a university educator.

大一大二成绩（Freshman and Sophomore Year Grades）
======
作为一个出于热爱报考物理并且立志探索科学前沿的物理学生，李世明同学挂了足足4门物理专业课（包括热学、电磁学、原子物理学和统计力学）和2门数学课（高等数学上和数学物理方法）。笑……

As a physics student driven by a passion for physics and an aspiration to explore the frontiers of science, Li Shiming struggled with a total of 4 physics major courses (including Thermodynamics, Electromagnetism, Atomic Physics, and Statistical Mechanics) and 2 mathematics courses (Advanced Mathematics I and Mathematical Physics Methods). 😅

大三上学期目标（Junior Year, First Semester Goals）
======
本学期学习电动力学和量子力学，是[中国科学院大学研招](https://admission.ucas.ac.cn/)考试的常考科目。务必要下功夫，学好学扎实。除此之外还有若干电子和师范类课程，要确保它们不挂科。

In this semester, Li Shiming is focused on studying Electrodynamics and Quantum Mechanics, which are common subjects in the Graduate Admissions Examination of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). It is imperative to put in the effort to excel and build a strong foundation in these subjects. In addition to these, there are several other courses in electronics and education-related areas, and it's essential to ensure that they are passed without any failures.

考研目标院校(Graduate School Targets)
======
[国家天文台](http://www.bao.ac.cn/)或[云南天文台](http://www.ynao.ac.cn/)，具体目标将根据本学期对量子力学和电功力学的学习进度选择。

Li Shiming's graduate school targets include the National Astronomical Observatory of China (NAOC) or the Yunnan Astronomical Observatory (YNAO). The specific choice will depend on the progress of their studies in Quantum Mechanics and Electrodynamics during this semester.
